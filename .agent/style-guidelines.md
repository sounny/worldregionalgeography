# World Regional Geography - Style Guidelines

## Typography

### Dashes

- **Do NOT use em dashes (—)** anywhere in the site content
- Use regular hyphens (-) or spaced en dashes ( - ) instead
- Example: "climate change - rising seas" instead of "climate change—rising seas"

### Other Punctuation

- Use curly quotes when appropriate for display text
- Keep punctuation consistent across all chapters

## Design Consistency

- All chapters should follow the same structural template
- Learning objectives, regional profiles, case studies, Texas connections, and knowledge checks should be present in each chapter
- Use emoji icons consistently for section headers

## File Naming

- Chapter folders: `XX-region-name` (two-digit number, hyphenated name)
- Use lowercase for all file and folder names
- Use hyphens, not underscores, for separating words in URLs

## Content Guidelines

- Include Texas connections in each regional chapter
- Every chapter should have 3-5 quiz questions with feedback
- Case studies should include discussion questions
- Key terms should be defined in each chapter
