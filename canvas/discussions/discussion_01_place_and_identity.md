## Week 1 | Chapter 1: Introduction to World Regional Geography

---

### Discussion Prompt

**How does where you live shape your daily life?**

Geographers study the relationship between people and places. Your location influences everything from the climate you experience to the food you eat, the language you speak, and the opportunities available to you.

For this discussion:

1. **Describe your "place"** – Where are you from or where do you currently live? Consider the physical geography (climate, landscape) and human geography (culture, economy, urban/rural setting).

2. **Analyze the connections** – How does your location shape at least TWO aspects of your daily life? Think about:

   - Climate and weather
   - Access to resources (food, water, jobs)
   - Cultural practices and traditions
   - Transportation and mobility
   - Economic opportunities

3. **Apply geographic thinking** – Would your life be different if you lived in a different region of the world? How?
