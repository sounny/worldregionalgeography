# World Regional Geography - Online Textbook

To create an engaging, brand-neutral, and pedagogically-rich online textbook for World Regional Geography that empowers students globally to understand the complex interconnections between physical landscapes, cultural systems, and human-environment interactions.

### Content Neutrality Directive (CRITICAL)

- **Generic Purpose**: This is a universal digital textbook for broad use across multiple institutions.
- **No Branding**: Do **NOT** use university branding or color schemes/logos specific to any single institution.
- **No TSU Reference**: Do **NOT** mention "Texas Southern University" or "TSU" anywhere in the content of this textbook. All institution-specific materials (grading, assignments, local policies) must be kept in the internal workspace (`G:\My Drive\0-TSU\WorldRegionalGeography-Internal`).
- **Monetization Ready**: Structure content to integrate seamlessly with YouTube video embedded content for broad educational reach.
- **Live Textbook**: [https://sounny.github.io/worldregionalgeography/](https://sounny.github.io/worldregionalgeography/)
