                <h2>Physical Geography</h2>
                
                <h3>Major Physical Regions</h3>
                <p>Russia's vast territory encompasses extraordinary physical diversity. Understanding these regions is essential for grasping why Russia developed as it did—and the challenges it faces today.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The Russian Plain (European Russia):</strong> Western Russia consists of flat to rolling terrain extending from the western borders to the Ural Mountains. This region contains the agricultural heartland, major rivers (Volga, Don), and the vast majority of Russia's population—about 80% of Russians live in this zone despite it comprising only 25% of the territory. Moscow sits at the center of this plain, and its position allowed the city to become the collection point for river-borne trade. The Volga River, Europe's longest, flows 2,300 miles from northwest of Moscow to the Caspian Sea.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The Ural Mountains:</strong> These ancient, eroded mountains (averaging only 6,000 feet) form the traditional boundary between Europe and Asia. Rich in minerals including iron, copper, bauxite, and precious metals, the Urals were critical to Soviet industrialization. Cities like Magnitogorsk were built specifically to exploit these resources.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Siberia:</strong> The vast eastern region between the Urals and the Pacific contains three sub-regions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>West Siberian Plain:</strong> One of the world's largest flatlands, containing enormous oil and gas deposits beneath frozen marshes</li>
                    <li><strong>Central Siberian Plateau:</strong> Rich in mineral wealth including diamonds, gold, and nickel</li>
                    <li><strong>Russian Far East:</strong> The Pacific coast region, closest to Japan and China, containing the major port of Vladivostok</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Lake Baikal</strong>, located in Siberia, deserves special mention—it is the world's oldest (25 million years) and deepest (1.6 km) lake, containing 20% of the world's surface fresh water.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Central Asia:</strong> The five "-stan" countries (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan) feature arid steppes and deserts in the lowlands, with the Tian Shan and Pamir mountains along southern borders. The <strong>Aral Sea</strong>, once the world's fourth-largest lake, has shrunk to about 10% of its original size due to Soviet-era irrigation projects diverting the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers for cotton cultivation—one of history's greatest environmental disasters.</p>

                <h3>Climate and Vegetation</h3>
                <p>Russia's climate reflects its vast size and continental position. Type D (continental) climates dominate, characterized by extreme temperature variations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Extreme continentality:</strong> Verkhoyansk in Siberia holds the record for the coldest temperature outside Antarctica (-90°F) while summer temperatures can reach 100°F—a 190°F annual range</li>
                    <li><strong>Permafrost:</strong> Permanently frozen ground underlies about 65% of Russian territory, extending to depths of 1,500 meters in some areas</li>
                    <li><strong>Short growing season:</strong> Most of Russia has fewer than 150 frost-free days, making agriculture challenging</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Vegetation Zones</h3>
                <p>Russia's vegetation zones form distinct east-west bands:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tundra:</strong> Arctic coastal zone with permafrost, lichens, and mosses—too cold for trees</li>
                    <li><strong>Taiga:</strong> The world's largest biome, covering 60% of Russia—a vast boreal forest of spruce, fir, and larch</li>
                    <li><strong>Mixed Forest:</strong> Transition zone in western Russia with deciduous and coniferous trees</li>
                    <li><strong>Steppe:</strong> Grasslands of southern Russia and Central Asia, historically home to nomadic peoples</li>
                    <li><strong>Desert:</strong> Arid zones in Central Asia, including the Kyzylkum and Karakum deserts</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>📜 The Soviet Legacy</h2>
                <p>The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR, 1922-1991) profoundly shaped this region's geography, economy, and politics. Understanding the Soviet legacy is essential for comprehending current conditions and ongoing conflicts.</p>

                <h3>The Russian Empire: Expansion and Russification</h3>
                <p>Before the Soviet era, the <strong>Russian Empire</strong> gradually expanded from its core around Moscow. By the end of the 19th century, Russian czars had accumulated territory stretching from Poland to Alaska, from the Arctic to Central Asia. The empire used <strong>Russification</strong>—promoting Russian language, culture, and Orthodox Christianity—to try to assimilate diverse populations. This policy was only partially successful; millions of Muslims, Buddhists, and speakers of non-Russian languages maintained their identities.</p>

                <h3>Formation of the Soviet Union</h3>
                <p>The Soviet Union emerged from the 1917 Russian Revolution and Civil War. The Communists reorganized the empire into <strong>Soviet Socialist Republics (SSRs)</strong> based on ethnic nationality:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>15 SSRs formed, each named for a dominant ethnic group (Russian, Ukrainian, Uzbek, etc.)</li>
                    <li>In theory, each republic was voluntarily allied with the USSR; in practice, Moscow controlled all</li>
                    <li>The Soviet system actually <em>created</em> some national identities that hadn't existed before (Uzbek, Kazakh, Turkmen)</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="note-callout">
                    <h4>💡 Why This Matters Today</h4>
                    <p>When the USSR collapsed in 1991, these administrative boundaries became international borders. The Soviet practice of scattering ethnic Russians throughout the empire left Russian minorities in every newly independent state—a key factor in conflicts like the 2022 Ukraine war.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Industrialization and the Command Economy</h3>
                <p>Soviet central planners rapidly industrialized the country through <strong>Five-Year Plans</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Collectivized agriculture replaced private farming (causing devastating famines in Ukraine and elsewhere)</li>
                    <li>Heavy industry prioritized over consumer goods</li>
                    <li>Factory cities built in Siberia and the Urals to exploit resources far from potential invasion routes</li>
                    <li>The <strong>Trans-Siberian Railway</strong> (the world's longest railway line at 5,772 miles) connected Moscow to Vladivostok</li>
                    <li>New "closed cities" built around secret nuclear and military facilities</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Collapse and Aftermath (1991)</h3>
                <p>The Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, creating 15 independent states:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Russia:</strong> Inherited the USSR's nuclear arsenal, UN Security Council seat, and about 75% of Soviet territory</li>
                    <li><strong>Baltic States:</strong> Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania quickly joined NATO and the EU</li>
                    <li><strong>Ukraine and Belarus:</strong> The largest western former republics, with deep historical ties to Russia</li>
                    <li><strong>Caucasus States:</strong> Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan—a volatile region of ethnic conflict</li>
                    <li><strong>Central Asian States:</strong> Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The 1990s brought economic collapse, declining life expectancy, and the rise of <strong>oligarchs</strong>—businessmen who acquired state assets during chaotic privatization. Russia's GDP fell by nearly 50% between 1991 and 1998.</p>

                <h2>🌐 Global Theme: Energy Geopolitics</h2>
                <p>Russia holds vast oil and natural gas reserves, making energy a key tool of geopolitical influence. Russia ranks among the world's top three producers of both oil and natural gas.</p>
                
                <h3>Energy as Power</h3>
                <p>European dependence on Russian gas gave Moscow significant leverage. Pipelines like Nord Stream connected Russia directly to Western Europe, bypassing transit countries like Ukraine. Energy revenues funded Russian government spending and military modernization.</p>

                <h3>The Ukraine Conflict</h3>
                <p>The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine marked a dramatic escalation in post-Soviet tensions. Geographic factors include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ukraine's position:</strong> A buffer state between Russia and NATO</li>
                    <li><strong>Crimea:</strong> Annexed by Russia in 2014; home to strategic naval base at Sevastopol</li>
                    <li><strong>Donbas:</strong> Industrial region with Russian-speaking population</li>
                    <li><strong>Energy transit:</strong> Pipelines crossing Ukraine to Europe</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The war has reshaped global energy markets, intensified NATO expansion, and created Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II.</p>

                <h2>🏔️ Central Asia: The Post-Soviet Stans</h2>
                <p>The five Central Asian republics share Soviet heritage, predominantly Muslim populations (though secular by tradition), and the geographic challenge of being <strong>landlocked</strong>—no access to the open ocean. Since independence in 1991, each has charted its own path.</p>

                <h3>The Aral Sea Disaster</h3>
                <p>The Aral Sea catastrophe stands as one of history's worst environmental disasters. In 1960, the Aral Sea covered 68,000 km²—the world's fourth-largest lake. Soviet planners diverted its feeder rivers (Amu Darya and Syr Darya) to irrigate cotton fields. By 2014, the lake had shrunk to 10% of its original size. Consequences include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fishing industry collapse—fishing towns now sit 150 km from water</li>
                    <li>Toxic dust storms from the exposed seabed, containing pesticide residues</li>
                    <li>Dramatic regional climate changes—hotter summers, colder winters</li>
                    <li>Public health crisis with elevated rates of cancer and respiratory disease</li>

                <p>Central Asia sits at the crossroads of competing powers:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Russia:</strong> Former colonial power, maintains military bases, security cooperation</li>
                    <li><strong>China:</strong> Massive investment through Belt and Road Initiative, purchases energy</li>
                    <li><strong>United States:</strong> Maintained military bases during Afghanistan war, now minimal presence</li>
                    <li><strong>Turkey:</strong> Cultural ties to Turkic-speaking populations (all except Tajikistan)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The region's oil, gas, and strategic location between major powers ensure continued international competition.</p>

                                <li><strong>Soviet legacy endures:</strong> The USSR's 1991 collapse created 15 new nations, ethnic conflicts, and borders that still generate tension (Ukraine, Nagorno-Karabakh, Transnistria).</li>
                                <li><strong>Energy dependence:</strong> Russia functions as a "petro-state"—oil and gas provide roughly half of government revenue and most exports, creating vulnerability to price swings.</li>
