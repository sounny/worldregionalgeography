                <div class="note-callout">
                    <h4>🏔️ 1. The Alpine Region</h4>
                    <p>The <strong>High Alps</strong> range from eastern France to Slovenia and include several related mountain systems:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>The Pyrenees</strong> – form the natural border between France and Spain</li>
                        <li><strong>The Apennines</strong> – run the length of the Italian peninsula</li>
                        <li><strong>The Carpathians</strong> – loop around Romania from Slovakia</li>
                        <li><strong>The Dinaric Alps</strong> – extend through the former Yugoslavia</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Mountains historically isolated communities, leading to distinct cultural groups. Today, the Alps are a major tourism hub—Switzerland alone earns billions annually from ski resorts and Alpine tourism.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="note-callout">
                    <h4>🌾 2. The Northern Lowlands (European Plain)</h4>
                    <p>This great plain extends from southern France through Germany and all the way to the Ural Mountains in Russia. Like the American Midwest, it serves as Europe's "breadbasket" with excellent agricultural soils. The region's flat terrain has also made it a historical invasion corridor—armies from Napoleon to Hitler used it to move rapidly across the continent.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="note-callout">
                    <h4>🏭 3. The Central Uplands</h4>
                    <p>The foothills of the Alps stretching across southern Germany are rich in natural resources—coal, iron ore, and timber—that fueled the Industrial Revolution. Today, this region remains Europe's manufacturing heartland, home to German automotive giants like BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Volkswagen.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="note-callout">
                    <h4>🌲 4. The Western Highlands</h4>
                    <p>These rugged, ancient mountains include the Scottish Highlands, the Welsh mountains, and portions of Scandinavia. Less suitable for agriculture, these regions support grazing livestock and forestry. The Pennines in England powered early textile mills with hydropower before coal mining became dominant.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>The Climate Advantage: The Gulf Stream</h3>
                <p>Europe's climate is remarkably moderate for its northern latitude. Paris is at the same latitude as Fargo, North Dakota, yet enjoys a much milder climate. The secret is the <strong>Gulf Stream</strong> (North Atlantic Drift).</p>
                
                <p>This powerful ocean current carries warm water from the Gulf of Mexico across the Atlantic, acting as an "oceanic radiator" that warms Western Europe. This allows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Year-round agricultural productivity in Western Europe</li>
                    <li>Ice-free ports along Norway's Arctic coast</li>
                    <li>Mediterranean climates that support olives, grapes, and citrus</li>
                    <li>Dense population settlement at latitudes that would otherwise be challenging</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Rivers: Europe's Transportation Network</h3>
                <p>Two major rivers divide Europe and have served as critical transportation corridors for millennia:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Rhine</strong> – flows from Switzerland north through Germany to Rotterdam, one of the world's busiest ports</li>
                    <li><strong>The Danube</strong> – flows from Germany east through Vienna, Budapest, and Belgrade to the Black Sea</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These rivers, combined with Europe's extensive coastlines, meant that most of the continent was accessible by water—a crucial advantage for trade and economic development.</p>
                
                <div class="inquiry-prompt">
                    <h3>🔍 Geographic Inquiry</h3>
                    <p>Scientists warn that Arctic ice melt could disrupt the Gulf Stream by adding fresh water to the North Atlantic, slowing the current's circulation. How might the weakening or collapse of the Gulf Stream affect: (1) Europe's agricultural productivity, (2) population distribution, and (3) the global economy?</p>

                <h3>Linguistic Diversity</h3>
                <p>Despite its small size, Europe contains remarkable linguistic diversity. The major language families include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Germanic Languages:</strong> English, German, Dutch, and Scandinavian languages (Norwegian, Swedish, Danish)</li>
                    <li><strong>Romance Languages:</strong> Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Romanian—all descended from Latin</li>
                    <li><strong>Slavic Languages:</strong> Russian, Polish, Czech, Slovak, Serbian, Croatian, Bulgarian, and Ukrainian</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Some languages fall outside these major families entirely: Hungarian (Uralic), Finnish and Estonian (Finno-Ugric), Basque (language isolate with no known relatives), and Greek (its own Indo-European branch).</p>
                
                <h3>The "Blue Banana" and Urban Development</h3>
                <p>Geographers have identified Europe's economic core as the <strong>"Blue Banana"</strong>—a crescent-shaped megalopolis stretching from Manchester and London through the Rhine Valley to Milan. This corridor contains:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Over 110 million people</li>
                    <li>Europe's highest concentration of industry and services</li>
                    <li>Major transportation hubs including Rotterdam, Frankfurt, and Brussels</li>
                    <li>Per capita incomes significantly above the European average</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Demographic Challenges</h3>
                <p>Europe faces a profound demographic challenge: an <strong>aging population</strong> combined with low birth rates. Several countries have fertility rates well below the replacement level of 2.1:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Italy: 1.24 children per woman</li>
                    <li>Spain: 1.19 children per woman</li>
                    <li>Germany: 1.53 children per woman</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This demographic shift creates pressure on pension systems, healthcare, and labor markets—driving debates about immigration policy.</p>
                
                <h3>Migration and Identity</h3>
                <p>Migration has reshaped Europe's cultural landscape. The 2015 refugee crisis, primarily from Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq, brought over one million asylum seekers to Germany alone. This migration has sparked political debates about:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Integration and multiculturalism</li>
                    <li>The relationship between national identity and European identity</li>
                    <li>The economic contributions vs. costs of migration</li>
                    <li>The rise of nationalist political movements</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="info-callout">
                    <h4>🏛️ Historical Perspective: From Empire to Nation-State</h4>
                    <p>Modern European borders largely emerged from the collapse of three empires after World War I: the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and the German Empire. Many contemporary conflicts—from the Balkans to Ukraine—have roots in these imperial legacies and the ethnic boundaries drawn in their aftermath.</p>

                <h2>🇪🇺 The European Union: Supranationalism in Action</h2>
                <p>The <strong>European Union (EU)</strong> represents humanity's most ambitious experiment in supranational governance—the voluntary transfer of sovereignty from nation-states to a transnational organization. Understanding the EU is essential to understanding modern Europe.</p>
                
                <h3>Origins: From Coal and Steel to Economic Union</h3>
                <p>The EU's origins lie in the aftermath of World War II. French diplomat Jean Monnet believed that by integrating the coal and steel industries of former enemies, war would become "not only unthinkable but materially impossible." This led to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1951:</strong> European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) – France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg</li>
                    <li><strong>1957:</strong> Treaty of Rome creates the European Economic Community (EEC)</li>
                    <li><strong>1992:</strong> Maastricht Treaty transforms the EEC into the European Union</li>
                    <li><strong>2002:</strong> The Euro currency launches in 12 countries</li>
                    <li><strong>Today:</strong> 27 member states (after UK's 2020 departure)</li>

                <p>The <strong>Schengen Agreement</strong> (1985) created a zone of free movement across 27 European countries. Within this area:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No passport controls at internal borders</li>
                    <li>Common visa policy for non-EU visitors</li>
                    <li>Coordinated external border security</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Not all EU members are in Schengen (Ireland maintains border controls), and some non-EU countries participate (Switzerland, Norway, Iceland).</p>

                                <li><strong>Peninsula of Peninsulas:</strong> Europe's extensive coastlines and deep relationship with the sea facilitated trade, exploration, and the spread of ideas throughout history.</li>
                                <li><strong>Four Landforms:</strong> The Alpine Region, Central Uplands, Northern Lowlands, and Western Highlands each shaped human settlement and economic development in distinct ways.</li>
                                <li><strong>Climate Advantage:</strong> The Gulf Stream gives Western Europe a remarkably moderate climate for its northern latitude, enabling year-round agriculture and dense population settlement.</li>
                                <li><strong>Cultural Mosaic:</strong> Three major language families (Germanic, Romance, Slavic) and centuries of migration created Europe's rich but sometimes contentious cultural diversity.</li>
                                <li><strong>Supranational Integration:</strong> The EU represents history's most ambitious experiment in voluntary sovereignty transfer, creating economic union and free movement across borders.</li>
                                <li><strong>Centripetal vs. Centrifugal:</strong> Europe demonstrates both unifying forces (shared currency, open borders, economic cooperation) and dividing forces (nationalism, linguistic diversity, uneven development).</li>
                                <li><strong>Demographic Challenge:</strong> Aging populations and low birth rates create pressure on pension systems and drive debates about immigration policy.</li>
                                <li><strong>Environmental Pressures:</strong> Industrial heritage has left environmental challenges including depleted fisheries, acid rain, and climate change impacts.</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Geographic Boundaries:</strong> Why is it difficult to define Europe's eastern boundary? How might this geographic ambiguity affect political relationships today?</li>
                        <li><strong>Supranationalism:</strong> What are the advantages and challenges of surrendering some national sovereignty to a supranational organization like the EU?</li>
                        <li><strong>Physical Geography & Development:</strong> How have mountains, rivers, and access to the sea shaped where Europeans have settled and built their economies?</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Discuss With Your Peers</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Could the EU model of integration work in other regions of the world? What geographic, cultural, or economic factors would need to be different?</li>
                        <li>The North Atlantic Drift keeps Western Europe temperate. What would happen to migration and settlement patterns if this ocean current were disrupted by climate change?</li>
                        <li>Brexit is an example of centrifugal forces pulling a region apart. What geographic factors might prevent other countries from leaving the EU?</li>
