World Regional Geography – Course Plan (Texas University)

Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive survey of the world’s major regions, exploring both their unique characteristics and the global forces that connect them. Students will examine physical landscapes, cultural patterns, economic and political systems, and environmental challenges across regions such as Europe, Africa, Asia, the Americas, and Oceania. Emphasis is placed on understanding how historical, social, and economic forces shape each region within an interconnected global context, fostering a truly multicultural and global perspective. The course is designed for a broad undergraduate audience (including non-majors) and fulfills core curriculum requirements by emphasizing critical thinking, effective communication, and intercultural understanding. Class sessions are highly interactive and student-centered – instead of rote memorization of facts, students engage in discussions, map-based activities, case studies, and collaborative problem-solving to actively “examine the world through a spatial lens” ￼. Texas-based examples and field experiences will ground global concepts in local reality, from urban development and environmental issues in Texas to the dynamics of the Texas-Mexico border region. By the end of the term, students will not only have factual knowledge of world regions, but also improved skills in analysis, communication, and ethical global citizenship.

Learning Objectives

This course aligns with Texas Core Curriculum objectives, including Critical Thinking, Communication, and Social Responsibility (global perspectives) ￼ ￼. By the end of the course, students will be able to:
	•	Identify key physical features, cultural characteristics, and demographic patterns of major world regions.
	•	Analyze how historical, political, economic, and cultural global forces shape regional landscapes and societies ￼. (For example, students will examine the effects of colonialism, globalization, or climate change on different regions.)
	•	Apply fundamental geographic concepts – such as place, space, scale, and landscape – to interpret regional case studies and world events.
	•	Think Critically about geographic problems by employing creative thinking, inquiry, evidence evaluation and synthesis of information rather than mere memorization ￼.
	•	Communicate geographic understanding effectively in multiple forms: writing clear essays and reports, delivering oral presentations, and interpreting or creating visual materials (maps, charts) ￼.
	•	Demonstrate intercultural competence by comparing diverse cultures and regions, and articulating how geography and place shape people’s lives and perspectives ￼.
	•	Engage in ethical and informed use of digital tools, including maps and data (and generative AI tools where appropriate), to investigate spatial patterns and trends. (This includes basic proficiency in GIS or online mapping to explore regional data.) ￼

Weekly Topics & Schedule of Readings/Activities

Overview: The schedule is organized by region, but each week also highlights a key global theme (such as climate change, migration, urbanization, or geopolitics) relevant to that region. This blended approach helps achieve the right balance between describing places/regions, explaining geographic concepts, and analyzing contemporary issues ￼. Course readings will include an introductory world geography textbook for background on each region, supplemented by journal articles or case studies on the week’s theme. Active-learning exercises (discussions, mapping labs, debates) are integrated weekly to reinforce concepts.
	1.	Week 1: Introduction to World Regional Geography – Foundations & Geographic Perspectives
	•	Topics: What is geography? Key concepts (region, place, location, scale, and globalization). Introduction to map reading and spatial thinking. Discussion of course goals and the value of geographic perspectives.
	•	Readings: Textbook Chapter 1 (Introduction to World Regional Geography); short article “Why Geography Matters” (covering the importance of spatial thinking and global awareness).
	•	Activities: Concept mapping exercise – students brainstorm definitions of place and space in small groups and connect them to personal examples. Map activity: interpreting different map projections and data maps to discuss how information presentation can shape our understanding of regions. Class discussion: global current events (e.g. a recent climate or migration news story) to highlight the course’s contemporary focus. The instructor also introduces course policies on generative AI and academic integrity in this first week (see “Strategies for Generative AI Use” below).
	2.	Week 2: Europe – Colonial Legacies, Migration & Identity
	•	Topics: Overview of Europe’s physical and human geography (from climates to languages). Historical legacies of colonialism and industrialization. The European Union and contemporary issues of migration, demographic change, and cultural identity.
	•	Readings: Textbook chapter on Europe; plus an article or case study on migration in Europe (e.g., refugee movements into the EU or Brexit and migration).
	•	Activities: Case study discussion: students analyze a case (such as the Syrian refugee crisis in Germany or France’s colonial history in Africa and its effects) and discuss in groups how historical geography still influences current events. Map analysis: interpreting a population density or migration flow map of Europe. Debate: Should borders be more open or closed? Students use evidence to argue different perspectives, practicing critical thinking about regional policy.
	3.	Week 3: Russia & Central Asia – Environment and Geopolitics
	•	Topics: Physical geography of Russia/Central Asia (tundra, taiga, arid steppes) and resource distribution. The legacy of the Soviet Union on the region’s political geography. Environmental challenges (e.g. Aral Sea desertification, Siberian permafrost thaw) and geopolitical issues (energy politics, territorial conflicts).
	•	Readings: Textbook chapter on Russia and Central Asia; news piece on climate change in Siberia or on Russia’s oil/gas economy and its geopolitical leverage.
	•	Activities: Climate case analysis: students examine before-and-after images of the Aral Sea or Arctic ice to visualize environmental change, then discuss human impact and policy responses. In-class simulation: students role-play as different countries in the region discussing management of an oil pipeline or water resource, highlighting geopolitical negotiation.
– Assignment Milestone: End of Week 3, the “Writing Place” assignment is introduced. Students have learned the concept of place and sense of place by now, so they will begin drafting their Writing Place essay (see Assignments below). They are encouraged to choose a meaningful place (it could be a local place in Texas or anywhere important to them) and apply geographic ideas from Weeks 1–3. Short peer brainstorming is done in class to help students develop ideas for their essays.
	4.	Week 4: Middle East & North Africa – Cultural Landscapes and Conflict
	•	Topics: Defining the Middle East & North Africa (MENA) as a region. Physical geography (deserts, Nile valley, etc.) and the crucial role of water. Cultural and religious geography (origin of major religions, linguistic patterns). Themes of conflict and geopolitics: oil economies, territorial disputes, and the geography of the Arab Spring.
	•	Readings: Textbook chapter on MENA; article on water scarcity and conflict (e.g., the Nile Basin or Jordan River) or on cultural change in a Middle Eastern city.
	•	Activities: Map exercise: students label and memorize key countries/capitals in MENA (building basic geographic literacy) followed by a quiz game. Document analysis: read excerpts from a Middle Eastern youth’s perspective (or a short piece like a blog from the region) and identify how place and cultural context shape their viewpoint. Group discussion: How does oil connect this region to Texas? (For instance, comparing a Texas oil town to an OPEC country, drawing global connections).
– Assignment Due: “Writing Place” Essay – Students submit a 3–4 page narrative essay describing a place that is meaningful to them and analyzing it with geographic concepts (location, locale, sense of place, etc.). They were guided to incorporate course concepts from the first weeks: for example, define place in their own words and convey their place’s location (where it is), locale (the physical/human characteristics of the setting), and the sense of place it holds for them ￼. They describe the feelings or sensory experiences the place evokes, the connections or networks it’s part of, any hidden histories of the place, and how reflecting on it changed their understanding of that place ￼. This low-stakes, reflective assignment supports “place-writing,” a creative form valued in geography, allowing students to find their personal writing voice while applying course ideas ￼ ￼. In feedback, TAs focus on narrative skill and concept integration, and also note each student’s unique writing voice. (Knowing each student’s writing voice serves as a baseline for future work – it helps instructors recognize the difference between a student’s own style and AI-generated text ￼.)
	5.	Week 5: Sub-Saharan Africa – Development and Global Connections
	•	Topics: Regional diversity in Sub-Saharan Africa (ecological zones from savanna to rainforest; hundreds of ethnic groups and languages). Legacies of colonialism and current development challenges. Themes: economic development, globalization of African economies (e.g. Chinese investment, resource extraction), public health geographies, and environmental issues (desertification, wildlife conservation).
	•	Readings: Textbook chapter on Sub-Saharan Africa; case study excerpt on a specific topic such as the impact of mobile phone technology on an African country’s development, or a piece on climate change in the Sahel.
	•	Activities: Data exercise: students interpret a graph or map of an indicator (e.g. GDP, HDI or malaria incidence) across African countries to practice quantitative literacy and discuss spatial patterns. Jigsaw activity: each group reads a short profile of a different African country’s development story (e.g. Ghana vs. Kenya vs. Nigeria) and then shares insights, highlighting the region’s diversity rather than stereotypes. Short reflection: connect today’s discussion to global systems (students reflect on how something like the chocolate or coffee they consume ties back to African regions, linking personal to global).
*– Assignment Launch: Scaffolded Research Project (“Topologia” Global Issues Paper) – Introduced this week, this is a semester-long research and writing project (named after a fictional undergraduate geography journal Topologia to which students will “submit”). Students choose an issue of global importance (e.g. climate change, migration, urbanization, food security, etc.) and analyze it from two different geographic perspectives, integrating human geography sub-disciplines ￼. For instance, a student might examine “deforestation” through an economic geography lens and a cultural ecology lens, or compare how two world regions experience and address a global issue. This project is broken into scaffolded steps with deliverables from Week 5 through Week 15 ￼ ￼. (See Assessment Plan below for details of each step.) In Week 5, students meet with a research librarian (in a library workshop) to learn how to find scholarly sources on their topic (Step 1) ￼. They then submit a brief topic proposal by the end of the week (Step 2) explaining their chosen issue, the two geographic lenses or regions they plan to focus on, and why it interests them ￼. Individual meetings with the instructor/TA will be scheduled next week to give feedback on proposals.
	6.	Week 6: South Asia – Population, Cities, and Climate
	•	Topics: Geography of South Asia (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, etc.): Monsoon climates and the Himalayas; the world’s second-largest population cluster. Themes include population growth and demographic transition, urbanization (mega-cities like Mumbai and Delhi), and climate vulnerabilities (flooding, sea-level threats in Bangladesh). Also cultural geography: religious diversity (Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism) and colonial history (British Raj).
	•	Readings: Textbook chapter on South Asia; excerpt from a report on urban challenges in an Indian city or a piece on climate adaptation in Bangladesh (e.g. building cyclone shelters).
	•	Activities: Population mapping: interpret a population density map of India or a population pyramid chart – what challenges/opportunities do these patterns present? Role-play: simulate a city council meeting in a South Asian city; some students are planners, others are slum residents, business owners, etc., debating an urban redevelopment project – this highlights social issues of rapid urbanization. Connection to Texas: Discuss parallels in water management between South Asia’s monsoon flooding and flood control in Houston, Texas (drawing global-local connections on environmental planning).
*– Research Project Step: Individual meetings (Step 3) with each student about their project proposal. During Week 6’s office hours or dedicated lab time, the instructor or TA meets one-on-one with students to refine their research question, suggest sources, and ensure the project is on track ￼. This personalized guidance helps students feel supported as they tackle independent research early on.
	7.	Week 7: East Asia – Industrialization and Urban Growth
	•	Topics: East Asia (China, Japan, Koreas, etc.): Physical geography from plateaus to earthquake zones. Economic geography focus – the dramatic industrialization of China and the “Asian Tigers”, and Japan’s high-tech economy. Urbanization and internal migration (e.g. China’s mega-cities and urban planning issues). Also discuss political geography (e.g. division of North/South Korea, China-Taiwan issues) and cultural change. Environmental impacts of rapid growth (air pollution, carbon emissions) are highlighted as a regional and global concern.
	•	Readings: Textbook chapter on East Asia; article on a topic like China’s urban migration (e.g. the hukou system of household registration) or a piece on environmental policy in East Asia.
	•	Activities: Case study: students examine one city (such as Shanghai or Tokyo) through a short video or reading, then identify in groups the factors driving its growth and challenges it faces (traffic, housing, etc.). Policy exercise: students pretend they are advisors to the government of an East Asian country, tasked with balancing economic growth and environmental protection – they must propose one policy and justify it, fostering critical thinking about sustainable development.
*– Research Project Step: First Draft, Part 1 due (Step 4). By the end of Week 7, students submit a Draft of their paper’s first half, focusing on one geographic perspective or region. For example, if investigating global food security, a student might devote this draft to the agricultural geography aspect in Region A. They must summarize and synthesize several scholarly sources for this aspect. This draft is graded for feedback only (low stakes) to encourage development of ideas. TAs return detailed comments in Week 8, guiding improvement for the next stages.
	8.	Week 8: Southeast Asia & Pacific/Oceania – Globalization and Diversity
	•	Topics: A combined look at Southeast Asia (Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, etc.) and Oceania (Australia, Pacific Islands). Discuss physical geography (tropical climates, Pacific Island environments) and cultural diversity (hundreds of languages and ethnic groups). Themes: globalization of trade and tourism in these regions, the strategic importance of South China Sea, and environmental issues like deforestation in Southeast Asia and sea-level rise threatening Pacific islands. Also address development disparities (Singapore’s economy vs. less-developed neighbors) and indigenous rights in places like Australia.
	•	Readings: Textbook chapters on SE Asia and Oceania (abridged); article on the effects of sea-level rise on an island nation or on rainforest loss in Borneo and global commodity chains.
	•	Activities: Interactive map lab: using an online mapping tool, students explore an interactive map of Southeast Asia’s land cover or economic data, practicing digital geography skills. Group presentation: small groups each focus on one country (e.g. Indonesia, Vietnam, Fiji, etc.) and present a “5-minute regional briefing” covering how global forces (trade, climate, etc.) are impacting that country – this helps develop communication skills and global awareness.
*– Assessment: Midterm Exam. In the middle of the semester (end of Week 8), a Midterm Exam is held to assess students’ grasp of the first half content (Weeks 1–7). The exam includes a mix of question types: some map identifications (e.g. locate countries or physical features), multiple-choice/short-answer questions on key concepts and regional facts, and a short essay where students must compare two regions on a theme (for example, contrast how Europe and East Asia have dealt with urbanization). This tests students’ ability to synthesize information across regions and think critically. (The exam is taken in class; for accessibility, a study guide and review session are provided in advance.)
	9.	Week 9: Latin America & the Caribbean – Urbanization, Inequality, and Environment
	•	Topics: Geography of Latin America (Mexico, Central & South America) and the Caribbean. Physical geography highlights (Andes, Amazon, hurricanes in Caribbean) and cultural history (indigenous civilizations, Spanish/Portuguese colonization, African diaspora in Caribbean). Key themes: urbanization (the rise of mega-cities like Mexico City, São Paulo), economic inequality and development models, deforestation of the Amazon and sustainability, and migration patterns. Texas connection: special attention to the U.S.–Mexico border region, given Texas’ location – issues of cross-border trade (NAFTA/USMCA), immigration, and cultural exchange in places like the Rio Grande Valley.
	•	Readings: Textbook chapter on Latin America; case study on the Amazon rainforest as a climate issue of global importance or an article on the U.S.–Mexico border (e.g. impacts of border policies on local communities).
	•	Activities: Case analysis: examine a scenario of a family migrating from Central America through Mexico to Texas – students map their journey and discuss push-pull factors in migration, connecting local Texas experiences to regional issues. Debate or role-play: students take roles as different stakeholders in Amazon deforestation (e.g. a farmer, an environmental activist, a government official, an indigenous community leader) to debate land use – highlighting multicultural perspectives and critical thinking about sustainable development. Local field connection: If feasible, this week might include an optional field trip or virtual tour of a Texas border city (or a guest speaker from a border community) to provide first-hand insight into border geography.
*– Research Project Step: Video Presentation (Step 5). By Week 9 or 10, once students have feedback on their first draft, they prepare a short Video Abstract of their research-in-progress ￼. In this 3–4 minute video (recorded via Zoom or phone), each student explains their research question, why it matters, and a summary of findings so far (from their first draft perspective). This fulfills the oral communication component – it gives practice in clearly communicating ideas orally and visually ￼. During a lab session, students share videos in small groups and give each other constructive feedback on clarity and engagement. (This step also reinforces learning: if a student can explain their project simply, it shows solid understanding.) The video is graded on effort and clarity, not on video production quality.
	10.	Week 10: North America (United States & Canada) – Regions at Home
	•	Topics: A look at the geography of North America, with a focus on the United States (including Texas) and Canada. We examine internal regional differences (e.g. the American South vs. the Midwest vs. the West Coast; Canadian provinces), urban vs. rural patterns, and issues such as migration (both domestic and international), industrial change (the Rust Belt to Sun Belt shift), and environmental challenges (wildfires in the West, hurricanes on the Gulf Coast, water scarcity in the Southwest). Texas examples are emphasized: for instance, urban growth in Texas’s major cities (Houston, Dallas, Austin) and their global ties, and environmental case studies like Hurricane Harvey’s impact on Houston or water management in the Rio Grande.
	•	Readings: Textbook chapter on North America; report or article on a contemporary issue like climate resilience in a Texas city or the cultural geography of Texas’s demographic change (e.g. Texas as a majority-minority state).
	•	Activities: Community study project: students work in teams to investigate the geography of our local region in Texas. Each team selects a specific aspect (e.g. urban development, agriculture, cultural landscape, or environmental issue in the local area) and does a mini-research: collecting a few facts or photos, then presenting how global processes (like international trade, migration, or climate change) are evident in our local landscape. This activity brings home the concept “Geography is everywhere” and that local places reflect broader regional and global trends. Class discussion: reflect on how studying distant world regions helps us understand our home better, and vice versa.
*– Research Project Step: Full Draft due (Step 6). By the end of Week 10, students submit a Full Draft of their research paper, now incorporating the second perspective or region and integrating any improvements from earlier feedback ￼. This draft likely combines the earlier first draft (revised) plus new analysis – for example, if one half was about economic geography of deforestation in the Amazon, the second half might add a cultural geography perspective on deforestation impacts on indigenous communities, or the student might have chosen to compare deforestation in the Amazon vs. Southeast Asia. The full draft must demonstrate synthesis – not just two separate sections, but a discussion of how the insights connect (this emphasis on synthesis over summary is a core goal of the project) ￼. TAs provide extensive feedback on argumentation, use of sources, and organization to guide students toward the final version.
	11.	Week 11: Global Urbanization & Migration (Thematic Synthesis)
	•	Topics: Stepping back from individual regions, this week takes a thematic approach across regions. We focus on two of the most powerful global trends: urbanization (the growth of cities) and human migration. We compare examples from different regions studied: mega-cities (Lagos, Tokyo, Mumbai, Mexico City, etc.) and their common challenges; rural-to-urban migration patterns worldwide; international migration flows and the idea of a global diaspora. We also consider how these trends are playing out in Texas (e.g. rapid urban growth in Texas cities, immigrant communities in Texas) as a microcosm.
	•	Readings: Selections from a chapter or report on global urbanization; a short piece on migration trends (possibly UN data summary or a human interest story of a migrant) covering multiple regions.
	•	Activities: Comparative analysis: students break into groups, each group takes one major city from a different world region (one from Africa, one from Asia, etc.) – they quickly research key stats (population, issues) and then we convene to compare and find commonalities/differences among global cities. Map plotting: using a world map, students plot and connect major migration routes (e.g. Latin America to US, Middle East to Europe, South Asia to Gulf States, etc.), then discuss causes of these movements and implications for both origin and destination regions. Reflection: How do global patterns of urban growth and migration affect our lives? Students might share observations from their own family/community experiences to connect the personal to global.
	12.	Week 12: Global Environment & Climate Change (Thematic Synthesis)
	•	Topics: Another cross-cutting theme: the global environmental crisis and climate change, examined through a regional lens. We review evidence of climate change (rising temperatures, melting ice, extreme weather) and then discuss how different world regions are affected unevenly and respond differently. Examples: intensifying hurricanes in the Atlantic (link to Gulf Coast/Texas impacts), desertification in Africa, sea-level threats to Pacific and Southeast Asian communities, shifting monsoons in South Asia, arctic melting in Russia, wildfire regimes in Australia and California, etc. We also discuss international cooperation (Paris Agreement) and climate justice (how those least responsible often suffer most).
	•	Readings: Excerpts from an IPCC report summary for a general audience (to cover scientific consensus on climate change); a short case study of a specific regional climate impact (such as Pacific Island nations’ adaptation efforts, or indigenous knowledge in Arctic climate monitoring).
	•	Activities: Climate data lab: students work with a simple digital tool or dataset (for instance, examine CO₂ emissions by region or temperature change maps) to interpret patterns. World Climate Policy simulation: the class does a simplified simulation of climate negotiations – teams represent different regions (e.g. USA/Europe, China, India, developing countries, etc.) and must decide on emissions targets or adaptation funding. This role-play highlights geopolitical and ethical dimensions of global environmental issues and builds negotiation and teamwork skills. Discussion: end with reflection on individual actions and community resilience – tie back to what Texas/local communities are doing for climate adaptation, reinforcing that learning leads to real-world engagement.
	13.	Week 13: Geopolitics and Globalization in the Digital Age
	•	Topics: In this capstone-themed week, we consider the future of world regions amid rapid globalization and digital transformation. Topics include the changing geopolitical order (emerging powers, international conflicts, supranational organizations like the UN); the impact of technology on geography (the digital divide between regions, the geography of social media or internet access); and the rise of generative AI and automation as a global phenomenon affecting work and society. We explore how innovations spread unevenly across regions and the ethical questions involved. We also revisit key concepts like nation-state, sovereignty, and boundary in light of globalization.
	•	Readings: An article on the state of globalization (e.g. trade or cultural globalization trends); and a contemporary piece on technology’s global impacts – for example, a geography journal commentary on digital labor or the global supply chain of AI ￼. (One suggested reading is Gilbert (2023) on digital labor and the future of work, which offers a geographic perspective on AI in society ￼.)
	•	Activities: Current events discussion: students bring in a recent news item related to geopolitics or technology (e.g. a conflict, a trade war, a tech breakthrough) and we map these events to regions and discuss underlying geographic contexts. Case study on AI: The class examines the “geography of AI” – e.g. where tech hubs are, where rare minerals for tech are mined, where data centers are located – to understand the spatial footprint of our digital world. This segues into a critical discussion on generative AI: students consider who benefits and who bears the costs of AI (energy consumption, labor for data labeling, etc.), linking back to course themes of development and ethics ￼. By analyzing AI from a human geography perspective, students practice critical thinking about technology in a global context. (This also reinforces the course’s approach to AI use – see below.)
*– Research Project Step: Peer Review (Step 7). In Week 13, students participate in a peer-review workshop for their research projects. Each student exchanges their full draft with a classmate and uses a guided checklist to provide constructive feedback on clarity, argument, use of evidence, and connection between the two perspectives. Peer-review is done in class or online, and then each student writes a short revision plan based on the feedback received. Peer review not only improves the papers but also hones students’ ability to critically evaluate written work (a key academic skill).
	14.	Week 14: Course Wrap-Up and Regional Synthesis
	•	Topics: In our final content week, we tie everything together. We revisit the big question: “What have we learned about how geography shapes our world?” Students reflect on major themes (globalization, inequality, cultural diversity, environmental sustainability) and how these themes manifest in different regions. We also discuss the role of geography in understanding current events and solving future challenges. This week highlights Texas and the U.S. in the context of world regions: how global forces have shaped local realities (summing up examples from throughout the course) and how local actions can impact global issues. The instructor leads a synthesis lecture/discussion that connects the dots between regions – emphasizing interdependence (for example, how a change in one region can ripple to others through trade, migration, climate, etc.).
	•	Readings: No new textbook chapter – instead, a short reflective piece (e.g. a blog or op-ed) on the importance of global geographic literacy for citizens, or excerpts from students’ own work (such as especially insightful passages from the “Writing Place” essays or research projects, shared anonymously with permission) to celebrate their learning.
	•	Activities: Regional trivia & review game: a fun quiz competition to review key facts and concepts from all regions (reinforcing knowledge in an enjoyable way). Reflection exercise: students write a one-page in-class reflection on how their understanding of a particular region or global issue has changed over the semester, demonstrating personal growth in perspective. Course evaluations are conducted. The instructor offers advice on applying geographic thinking beyond the class, and highlights further geography courses or activities (like study abroad or local volunteering) for interested students.
– Assignment Due: Final Research Paper (Step 8). Students submit their final revised research paper in Week 14 or by the end of the scheduled finals period. This final paper (approximately 8–10 pages) incorporates improvements from feedback and peer review, demonstrating the student’s ability to synthesize scholarly sources and present an original analysis ￼. In essence, each paper is written in the style of a geography journal article for a general undergraduate audience, focusing on a global issue with depth and the student’s own critical voice. Through the scaffolded process, students have practiced research skills, critical reading, synthesis of multiple sources, and polished academic writing. They also submit a short reflection on what they learned through the project – many express a new understanding of the research process and more confidence in tackling complex topics, having moved beyond simple summary to making their own connections among ideas ￼.
	15.	Week 15: Final Exam or Presentations
	•	The course culminates in a Final Assessment. Depending on institutional requirements, this can be a traditional final exam scheduled in exam week, or a final presentation session:
	•	Option A: Final Exam: A comprehensive exam testing knowledge of remaining regions (Weeks 9–14 content) and cumulative understanding. Like the midterm, it could include a mix of question types. One part of the final might be an essay asking students to draw examples from multiple regions to discuss a theme (for instance, “Compare the impact of climate change in two different regions and evaluate how geographic context shapes each response”). This assesses students’ ability to integrate and apply knowledge broadly – aligning with critical thinking and global perspective objectives.
	•	Option B: Research Presentations: If time permits, students deliver brief presentations of their research projects to the class (5 minutes each, possibly in a poster session or lightning-talk format). This serves as the final showcase of their work and an opportunity to practice oral communication of research. Peers can ask questions, and everyone gains exposure to a variety of topics beyond their own. The atmosphere is celebratory, treating the class as a mini “conference” of world geography topics.
	•	In either case, Week 15 focuses on synthesizing learning outcomes and ensuring students can articulate what they’ve learned. We wrap up with encouragement for students to remain curious about the world and to use their geographic insights in whatever fields they pursue.

(Throughout the semester, flexibility is built in to adjust pace or discuss breaking news events. For example, if a major global event occurs that is relevant to class (natural disaster, geopolitical crisis), the instructor will devote time to discussing its regional context, reinforcing the real-world relevance of course material.)

Assessment Plan

The course uses a variety of assessments to encourage continuous engagement, skill development, and mastery of content. All major assignments are scaffolded (broken into smaller steps) to support student success and to practice core skills incrementally. Grades will be based on the following components:
	•	Participation and In-Class Activities (15%) – Ongoing. Students earn credit for active participation in class discussions, group exercises, and completion of short in-class or online activities. This includes contributing to group work, engaging in Q&A, completing small reflective writes, etc. Active learning is central: at least one-third of class time involves student-centered activities. For example, students might get a participation grade for bringing in a current event one week, or for collaborating on a map exercise. These low-stakes points incentivize consistent involvement and help the instructor gauge understanding in real time. (Attendance is expected as part of participation, especially on days with interactive exercises or peer-review sessions.)
	•	Map Quizzes (10%) – Weeks 2–9. To build geographic literacy, there will be a few short map quizzes. These quizzes focus on identifying countries, capitals, or key physical features in the regions we cover. Rather than high-stakes exams, they are treated as learning tools – students can retake in a modified format or drop one low score. The goal is to ensure students can visualize where places are and thus better understand regional contexts in discussions. Map quizzes support the core spatial awareness aspect of geography (knowing what is where), but they are kept manageable in scope and paired with study aids (practice maps, online drills).
	•	“Writing Place” Reflective Essay (15%) – Assigned Week 3, Due Week 4. This is the first major assignment, designed as a low-stakes, creative exercise to develop writing skills and personal connection to geographic concepts. In a 3–4 page first-person narrative, students describe a specific place that is deeply meaningful to them and analyze it using concepts of place from class. They must incorporate ideas such as the place’s location, the locale (features and context), and sense of place (the subjective meaning and feelings associated) ￼. The assignment prompt provides structure: for example, students are asked to define “place” in their own words (drawing on class readings like Tim Cresswell’s definition) and to include reflections on how their chosen place connects to broader contexts – “connections and networks the place is part of, hidden histories of the place, and its physical topography” ￼. Finally, they reflect on how writing about this place changed their understanding of it ￼. This essay is graded on thoughtfulness, use of detail and description, and integration of geographic concepts, not on having any “right” answer. It is worth 15% to emphasize its importance in skill-building, but generous feedback is given and an option to revise for a higher grade is provided (since the aim is improvement). Rationale: This assignment cultivates an authentic writing voice and personal investment in the subject matter ￼. Many students find it refreshing to write in a personal style; it “enables students to take creative ownership of the writing process and voice” ￼. It also provides instructors with a sample of each student’s writing ability and style early on, which is valuable for mentoring writing development and for later verifying originality ￼. Overall, this assignment meets core Communication objectives by developing clear written expression, and fosters Critical Thinking as students analyze a familiar place in new ways.
	•	Midterm Exam (15%) – Week 8. The midterm is a content assessment covering roughly the first half of the course (through Southeast Asia). It includes objective sections (e.g. multiple-choice, matching, or short answer questions on key terms, concepts, and regional facts) and a short essay section. In the essay, students must demonstrate higher-order thinking by, for instance, discussing a theme comparatively across two regions or explaining a concept using examples from class. The exam is designed to measure students’ retention of core knowledge as well as their ability to synthesize information (addressing the critical thinking core goal). Exam preparation is supported by a review session and a study guide highlighting learning objectives. Since this is a broad core course, the exam also checks that students have attained a base level of world geography literacy (e.g. knowing major countries and features, understanding basic trends), which is important for informed citizenship.
	•	Scaffolded Research Project – “Topologia” Global Issue Paper (30%) – Weeks 5–14. This is the signature project of the course, emphasizing research skills, critical thinking, and written/oral communication. It is modeled on the approach by Gerlowski et al. (2025) ￼ ￼, adapted for world regional geography. The project is broken into eight milestones spread across the term, allowing students to build their research and writing in stages (scaffolding). The topic is an issue of global importance that the student will explore in depth. They must bring in two distinct geographical perspectives or scales to analyze the issue, and incorporate examples from at least two world regions. The end product is a journal-style research paper ~8–10 pages long aimed at an undergraduate audience (hence the fictional journal name “Topologia”). The process and grading are structured as follows:
	•	Step 1: Library Research Workshop (Week 5, 0% graded but mandatory). Students attend a session with a librarian to learn how to use academic databases, find peer-reviewed journal articles, and evaluate sources. (This addresses core Information Literacy and preparation for critical research.)
	•	Step 2: Topic Proposal (5%) – Due Week 5. A one-page proposal where the student identifies their chosen global issue and the two geographic lenses or regional case studies they will use, with a brief rationale. For example, a student might propose: “I will research water scarcity as a global issue, comparing how it manifests in the Middle East vs. North America, and analyzing it through an environmental geography lens and a political geography lens.” They must list at least two preliminary sources. The proposal is graded on clarity and viability of the topic. Instructor feedback ensures each student has a focused, researchable topic moving forward ￼.
	•	Step 3: TA/Instructor Meeting (formative) – Week 6. After proposals, each student has a short individual meeting with the TA or instructor. In this check-in (ungraded), they discuss any challenges, refine the research question, and get additional suggestions for sources or angles ￼. This personalized guidance is meant to boost student confidence and direction early in the project.
	•	Step 4: First Draft – Part 1 (5%) – Due Week 7. Students submit a 3–4 page draft focusing on the first perspective or region of their issue. Essentially, this is half of their paper written out. For example, if the project is on water scarcity in Middle East and North America, the student might write this first draft on “Water scarcity in the Middle East from an environmental geography perspective,” using several sources to describe and analyze the situation. They are instructed not to just summarize each source, but to begin identifying themes, patterns, and gaps from those sources – practicing synthesis in writing ￼. This draft is graded with a light weight for completion and given extensive feedback (content, writing, and how well they are synthesizing rather than copying information). It allows the student to iterate and improve before the final paper.
	•	Step 5: Video Abstract Presentation (5%) – Due Week 9. Each student creates a short video presentation (~3 minutes) summarizing their project in layperson’s terms – what question they’re asking, why it matters, and a couple of interesting findings so far ￼. They should mention both perspectives or regional examples they are covering. The video can be as simple as a recorded Zoom talk or a narrated slideshow; the focus is on clear oral communication of their research. Videos are shared in class or online for peer feedback. This component reinforces oral communication skills (a core outcome) and helps students distill their argument concisely. It’s graded on content and effort, not cinematography.
	•	Step 6: Full Draft (ungraded or minor grade) – Due Week 10. Students turn in their full draft (combining revised Part 1 + new Part 2 addressing the second perspective/region, plus a conclusion). This draft is ideally complete in argument, so that meaningful peer and instructor feedback can be given. Depending on instructor preference, this could be ungraded or given a small completion grade; the main point is to ensure everyone has a substantial draft for review. TAs mark up these drafts with constructive comments on how well the student is connecting the two halves, the strength of their thesis, and any issues like citation problems or unclear sections. Emphasis is on pushing students from summary to synthesis – e.g. pointing out places they can explicitly compare or integrate insights, rather than listing what each source says ￼. Common feedback at this stage might be, “Explain how Source A and Source B relate or differ, rather than just describing each. What is the bigger story they tell together about your issue?”.
	•	Step 7: Peer Review (5%) – Week 13. Students exchange papers and fill out a provided peer review worksheet. This asks them to identify the paper’s main argument, list two strengths, and two suggestions for improvement (such as “Is the connection between the two regional examples clear?” or “Where could the writer’s voice be stronger?”). Each student receives feedback from one peer and also gives feedback. The act of peer reviewing is graded to ensure effort. This step not only helps improve the papers but also trains students in critical evaluation of academic work – an important skill beyond this course. Additionally, by reading a classmate’s paper, students often learn something about another region or topic, reinforcing the collaborative learning environment.
	•	Step 8: Final Research Paper (10%) – Due Week 14 (or Finals week). The final polished paper (~8–10 pages plus references) is submitted and graded with a detailed rubric. Criteria include: clarity of thesis, depth and synthesis of research (did the student integrate multiple sources and viewpoints? ￼), organization, use of evidence (citations from credible sources), quality of insights or analysis, and writing mechanics. A strong paper will read as an insightful overview of the chosen issue, highlighting how geographic context (and possibly differences between two regions or perspectives) influences that issue. For example, a conclusion might compare how water scarcity challenges in the Middle East vs. North America require different solutions – thus showing a global comparative understanding. The final paper grade constitutes a significant portion of the project’s 30%. Students are also asked to submit a short statement of what they learned and how they used feedback in revision, to encourage reflection on the learning process.
The scaffolded nature of this project is designed to “unveil the hard work of synthesis” and academic research by breaking it into manageable steps ￼. By iterating through proposals, drafts, and feedback, students practice college-level research skills in a supported way rather than cramming a term paper at the last minute. The project aligns with core goals: it demands critical thinking (analyzing and synthesizing sources, not just summarizing ￼), communication (written paper and oral/video presentation), and a global perspective (since the topics are global and often involve multiple regions). It’s also an antidote to the copy-paste tendencies; because students must inject their own voice and continually refine their work, it reduces reliance on shortcuts like AI generation and instead emphasizes genuine learning and skill development ￼.
	•	Final Exam (10%) – Week 15 (Finals). If a final exam is given (option A as described above), it will account for the remaining percentage. The final exam is similar in structure to the midterm but with an emphasis on the latter half of the course and holistic understanding. It often features an essay asking students to draw connections across regions and themes, demonstrating that they can “think geographically” about the world as a whole. If final presentations are done instead of an exam, the presentation (along with perhaps a brief written reflection) would be graded for this portion. In either scenario, the final assessment ensures that students can articulate key takeaways and meet the learning objectives (especially in critical thinking and global perspective) under a summative context.
	•	Extra Credit Opportunities: To encourage enrichment, a few optional extra credit tasks may be offered. Examples: attend a campus talk or webinar related to international/global issues and write a one-page reflection connecting it to course content; or complete an additional online geography module (e.g. a self-paced GIS tutorial or a cultural geography podcast review). These opportunities let motivated students deepen their learning and can add a small boost to their grade, while remaining entirely optional.

Note: Assignments explicitly incorporate Texas or local context where possible. For instance, the “Writing Place” essay often leads students to write about local places (many choose hometowns or meaningful spots in Texas, linking personal geography to course theory). The research project encourages topics that might include a Texas case study if relevant (e.g. comparing an issue in Texas vs abroad, such as border health issues, or Houston’s climate adaptation vs another city’s). Such integration ensures that core curriculum multicultural/global goals are met not only by looking abroad but also by reflecting on our own community within the global context.

Strategies for Integrating Generative AI (Use & Limits)

This course takes a proactive, critical and ethical approach to generative AI tools (like ChatGPT) in line with emerging best practices ￼ and the insights from Gerlowski et al. (2025) on teaching with AI. Rather than ignoring AI or simply banning it, we openly discuss its capabilities and pitfalls, and establish clear guidelines for its responsible use. Key strategies include:
	•	AI Literacy Education: Early in the course (Week 1 and revisited during Week 13’s tech theme), we explain what generative AI is and how it works. Students learn that models like ChatGPT do not truly “understand” information but statistically predict text, which means they can produce incorrect or fabricated information and reflect biases present in training data ￼. We discuss terms like “hallucination” (when AI invents false facts) and emphasize why blindly trusting AI output is dangerous. This theoretical understanding empowers students to be more critical users.
	•	Ethical and Global Context Discussion: We incorporate content on the ethical implications of AI – for example, reading about the environmental footprint of large AI models and the often-hidden human labor (like content moderators or dataset labelers) behind AI technologies ￼. By treating AI as a topic of geographical inquiry (where are the data centers? who has access to AI? what communities are affected by automation?), students gain a global, critical perspective on technology, consistent with the course’s human geography scope. This also ties into our core objective of social responsibility and global awareness.
	•	Clear Usage Policy: The syllabus has a transparent policy on AI usage for coursework. In short: Students may use generative AI tools in a supplemental way – such as brainstorming ideas, asking for clarification of a concept, or getting suggestions for improving their writing – but not to write their assignments for them. Using AI to generate any substantial portion of graded work (such as having it write an essay or answer exam questions) is considered academically dishonest unless explicitly allowed as part of an assignment. We clarify the difference between permissible assistive use (e.g. using Grammarly or an AI for grammar checking/editing, which we liken to a more advanced spellchecker) and impermissible use (having an AI produce original content that the student submits as their own) ￼. As the line can blur, we emphasize transparency: if a student does use an AI tool in the process (say, they asked ChatGPT to explain a difficult article or to generate practice quiz questions to study), they are encouraged to note that in their process or as a comment in their submission. That way it’s out in the open and can be discussed without penalty. This approach treats AI as a tool to be managed, not a forbidden fruit.
	•	Skill Development over “Policing”: We stress to students why certain AI use is limited – not as a moral judgment, but because outsourcing their work to AI short-circuits their own learning process. For example, if a student used AI to write the Writing Place essay, they would miss the chance to develop their personal voice and narrative skill – a key course goal ￼. We cite evidence (and our own observations) that relying on AI for writing can hinder improvement of communication skills and deeper understanding of content ￼. By framing it this way, students see that the policy is about maximizing their growth, not about punishment. We also acknowledge the reality: students face time pressures and might be tempted by AI as a shortcut, but we encourage them to see the course as an opportunity to practice thinking and writing – “the long-term benefits outweigh the short-term convenience.” This perspective was advocated by Gerlowski et al., who note that we don’t view use of GAI as a moral failing, but as a symptom of pressure – our job is to address the root causes and help students succeed without crutches ￼. Therefore, we strive to make assignments meaningful and scaffolded to reduce panic and last-minute AI “cheating.”
	•	Using AI as a Learning Tool (Critical Engagement): We include at least one activity where students do interact with generative AI for learning purposes under supervision. For instance, in a lab session, we might ask students to pose a geography question to ChatGPT (such as “Explain the causes of urbanization in Africa” or “Summarize the impacts of climate change in Bangladesh”) and then have the students critique the AI’s answer using their course knowledge and research skills. In small groups, they’ll check the AI response for accuracy, completeness, and bias. This exercise often reveals AI’s limitations (perhaps the AI gives a generic answer, misses recent data, or even includes a false “fact”). Students then correct or improve the answer themselves. This accomplishes two things: (1) Students practice critical thinking and fact-checking, and (2) they learn how to use AI output as a starting point that requires human judgment, rather than an authoritative final word. It reinforces that critical human insight is still essential, and they become more savvy about AI-generated content.
	•	Maintaining Academic Integrity: To ensure fairness, we make it clear that if a student bypasses the guidelines and submits AI-generated work as if it were their own, it will be treated under academic integrity policies (plagiarism/cheating). We don’t rely on “detection” software alone (as those are fallible and raise their own issues), but we do have the advantage of knowing students’ writing voices from the early essay ￼. If a later submission suddenly reads completely differently (no personal voice, oddly generic or overly polished in a way that doesn’t match the student’s usual work), it raises a red flag. We reserve the right to ask students about their process or even have an oral discussion to verify understanding if needed. This is handled case-by-case, with an educational mindset (we’d rather have a learning conversation than immediately punitive). However, the strong messaging from day one – that the purpose of assignments is to build your skills – aims to dissuade students from resorting to unauthorized AI use.
	•	Alignment with Best Practices: The course’s approach mirrors what many universities (like UW–Madison in 2024) have encouraged: using AI to build students’ competencies for the future rather than banning it outright ￼. We explicitly talk about the fact that students will likely encounter AI in their careers and daily life, so it’s better to learn to use it responsibly now. For example, one of the stated goals is that students “gain literacy in AI tools, develop core competencies in conjunction with AI, and build capacity to live and work in tandem with evolving AI” ￼. By treating generative AI as both an object of study and a cautiously used tool, we meet those goals. Students learn about AI in a geographic context (e.g., digital divides, resource usage) and also learn practically when and how to incorporate AI into their workflow.
	•	Continuous Reflection: We invite open dialogue about AI throughout the course. After the dedicated AI discussions, students can share their views – do they find it useful, do they feel it threatens learning, etc. We also revisit our policy if needed as the technology evolves. The instructor stays updated on the university’s latest guidelines regarding AI in classes. If grammar-checking and text-generating tools converge (as they are doing), we’ll adapt and clarify, always coming back to the core principle: the work students submit should reflect their own learning and skills, with any tools used being appropriately acknowledged ￼.

In summary, the strategy is: educate and guide rather than simply prohibit. The class becomes a space to critically evaluate AI’s role in society (a geography topic in itself) and to learn personal strategies for using AI ethically. This not only helps students in this course but prepares them to be thoughtful users of AI in the future, aligning with our broader educational mission.

Optional Enhancements and Enrichments

To further enrich the learning experience – especially for students who want to go above and beyond – the course offers several optional enhancements. These are not required, but strongly encouraged opportunities that cater to different learning styles and deepen the practical understanding of world geography:
	•	Fieldwork Opportunities: Connecting classroom knowledge with the real world. Fieldwork is a cornerstone of geographical learning, providing *“unrivalled opportunities to engage with both familiar and unfamiliar settings and gain critical insights into geographical processes” ￼ ￼. We plan at least one optional field activity. For example, students can join a one-day field trip to a local site of geographic interest. This might be:
	•	A visit to a nearby urban neighborhood in the city to study urban geography first-hand – observing land use, architecture, and neighborhood change. Students might do a field sketch or map of the area and talk to local residents or business owners (with guidance and ethical considerations) to learn how globalization or cultural dynamics have shaped that local place. (In Texas, for instance, visiting a historic district shaped by a particular immigrant community could illustrate global-local cultural connections.)
	•	A field trip to a rural area or environmental site – such as a state park, a river, or an agricultural area – to examine human-environment interaction. For instance, visiting a Texas Hill Country site to discuss water resources and land management, or a farm to discuss agriculture’s global links (crops, markets).
	•	An exploratory visit to the Texas–Mexico border region (if feasible as a longer trip or virtually) – to directly observe the landscape of the border, such as the twin cities of El Paso–Ciudad Juárez or the Lower Rio Grande Valley. Students could meet with community organizations or researchers to understand border issues like migration, trade, and environmental management. (If travel is not possible, a virtual fieldtrip using tools like Google Earth or a documentary could substitute.)
These field experiences are followed by reflection discussions or short assignments (e.g. a field journal). Even students who cannot attend the trips can benefit from in-class debriefs and photo tours shared by those who did. The goal is to make geography tangible: seeing concepts from class “in the wild” often sparks excitement and deeper comprehension. Fieldwork, whether local or farther afield, helps students appreciate complexity and context – they realize, for example, how economic or cultural globalization impacts a specific street corner or ecosystem. It also fosters observational skills and curiosity. (Note: All field activities are planned with safety and inclusivity in mind. Alternate arrangements or sites will be offered to ensure everyone has access. Any field trip is subject to university approvals.)
	•	Service Learning Component: In line with the core curriculum’s emphasis on social responsibility and civic engagement, an optional service-learning project is available. This involves partnering with a community or campus organization on a geography-related issue. For example, interested students could volunteer with a local refugee support center, a cultural heritage museum, or an environmental conservation group. They would spend a few hours over the semester in service and then relate the experience to course themes in a short reflection paper. One concrete idea is collaborating with a local NGO that maps community assets or needs (using simple GIS) – students could help collect data (e.g. mapping food deserts in the city, or surveying bilingual signage in a neighborhood) and thus apply geographic techniques in service of the community. This kind of project links global and local: if we’re studying migration globally, working with refugees locally in Texas connects directly; if we discuss environmental issues, helping a local river cleanup ties in. Service learning is optional and can confer extra credit or fulfill a honors contract requirement, etc. The benefits include hands-on experience, improved empathy and multicultural understanding, and practicing communication with diverse audiences. It embodies the idea that geography isn’t just academic – it’s actionable knowledge for real-world problem-solving.
	•	GIS and Digital Geography Enhancements: Modern geography increasingly uses geospatial technologies. For students interested in tech or data (or those just curious to visualize what we learn), we offer optional GIS-based labs or tutorials. These might include:
	•	An ArcGIS Online workshop where students learn to make a simple map. For instance, mapping a dataset like global GDP per capita or world population density by country, then styling the map and interpreting patterns. This aligns with learning outcomes around using technology to analyze spatial data ￼. It’s a one-session introduction, requiring no prior GIS experience, just to show how mapping software can reveal patterns and is widely used in many fields.
	•	A StoryMap project (optional in lieu of a short paper or as extra credit): Esri StoryMaps allow students to create an interactive webpage combining maps, text, and multimedia to “tell the story” of a place or issue. A student might create a StoryMap about, say, climate change impacts around the world, including maps and pictures for several regions, or a StoryMap on “My Journey” where an international student maps their personal migration story and connects it to broader migration trends. This creative digital project could be shared at the end of the course (for those who choose it) to celebrate diverse perspectives.
	•	Integrating simple tools like Google Earth: In some weekly activities (as mentioned, e.g., Week 8 uses an interactive map), we demonstrate how to use Google Earth or other free tools to explore places virtually. An optional assignment might be “Virtual Field Trip”: using Google Earth Street View to explore a city in another country and writing a short report on observations of the landscape. This builds spatial observation skills when actual travel isn’t possible.
These digital enhancements are in line with the course objective of digital literacy. By engaging with GIS or online maps, students see how geographers measure and analyze the world, reinforcing their spatial thinking and data interpretation skills ￼. It can also pique interest in the geospatial field, showing practical applications of geography (valuable for career awareness). Students not inclined to do this won’t be disadvantaged (core content remains accessible without GIS), but those who do often find it rewarding to literally “map out” what they learn.
	•	Guest Speakers and Interdisciplinary Links: While not in the original prompt, another possible enhancement is bringing in a guest lecture or two. For example, a professor or grad student who is an expert on Latin America might give a talk, or a city planner from the local government could speak about urban growth (connecting to our topics and showing real-world application in Texas). These experiences, if available, enrich the curriculum and show students how regional geography knowledge is used in various careers. Similarly, if there are relevant cultural events on campus (an international festival, a study-abroad info session, etc.), the instructor will announce those and possibly offer a tiny incentive for attendance, to encourage immersion in global learning outside class.
	•	Cultural Enrichment Activities: To bolster multicultural understanding, optional activities like international film screenings or food and culture nights can be organized. For example, watching a film set in a particular region (and discussing its geographic themes) or having a potluck where students bring or sample foods from different regions we’ve studied (while discussing how geography influences cuisine). These informal, fun activities build class community and reinforce learning in a memorable way.

All these enhancements remain optional. They are designed to inspire and deepen engagement without overloading students who may already have full schedules. Students can choose what aligns with their interests – be it getting outside the classroom, volunteering, or experimenting with digital maps. Those who take part often report a higher level of connection to the material: fieldwork makes it real, service makes it meaningful, and GIS skills make it empowering. And importantly, these opportunities address varied learning styles: tactile/experiential learners shine in fieldwork, social learners in service projects, visual/data learners in GIS activities.

In conclusion, this World Regional Geography course is structured to be comprehensive, innovative, and student-centered. It meets core curriculum requirements by developing critical thinking (through analysis and synthesis assignments), communication (through intensive writing and presentation practice), and global/multicultural perspectives (through content and activities that traverse cultures and places) ￼ ￼. Traditional regional coverage is enhanced with thematic explorations of urgent global issues, helping students see the relevance of geography to real-world problems. The integration of generative AI is handled thoughtfully – preparing students to be critical thinkers in an AI-infused world, rather than avoiding the topic. Active learning pedagogies are at the heart of each week, recognizing that students learn best by doing and reflecting, not just listening. And with the optional enrichments, students are empowered to take their curiosity further – whether by stepping into the field, engaging the community, or leveraging technology.

By the end of the semester, a student in this course should feel more informed about the world’s regions, more aware of their own place in a global context, and more skilled in the arts of inquiry and expression. Ideally, they will carry forward an appreciation for geography’s integrative perspective – understanding that to solve any big problem (be it climate change, migration, or cultural conflict), one must consider the where and why there. In a Texas university setting, with Texas examples woven in, students also gain a nuanced appreciation of how global and local are interconnected. This course thus serves as both an academic journey around the world and a journey of personal and intellectual growth, equipping students with knowledge and skills that fulfill core goals and prepare them for a globally engaged life.
